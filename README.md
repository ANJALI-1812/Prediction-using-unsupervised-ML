# Prediction-using-unsupervised-ML
OBJECTIVE-To predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually using iris dataset

ALGORITHM USED- K-Means
K-means is an unsupervised classification algorithm, also called clusterization, that groups objects into k groups based on their characteristics. The grouping is done minimizing the sum of the distances between each object and the group or cluster centroid.

Workflow behind Implemention of K-Means Clustering:

Choose the number of clusters k

Select k random points from the data as centroids

Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid

Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters

Repeat steps 3 and 4
